During first year, I created a battery and circuit panel mount for the Robotics for Space Exploration design teamâ€™s 2019-2020 Mars Rover. In this project, I was required to communicate with both the mechanical and electrical sub-teams to design a system that was compact, robust, and allowed for quick battery exchanges during competitions. 

This design houses the 6 batteries which power the Mars Rover, keeping them secure to ensure consistent electrical connectivity as the rover traverses over uneven desert ground at high speeds. The batteries are secured into the slots ankept tightly secured with a ratchet strap, and connect to the main circuit panel on the backside of the acrylic. 

The back panel is made of acrylic, and was laser cut at the Myhal Light Fabrication Facility. The brackets are 3D printed PLA.
