In MIE243, our 2nd year mechanical engineering design course, we designed gearboxes in groups of 4 to apply the knowledge we had acquired in class; I was responsible for the design of the housings, as well as the assembly of the gearbox CAD. We were required to design gearboxes which were completely 3D printed under 8 hours; they were 3D printed in the University of Toronto mechanical engineering facilities and assembled by a teaching assistant; w. This gearbox has a 16:1 reduction, and has a colinear input and output.
