In MIE243, our 2nd year mechanical engineering design course, dissection and analysis of a jigsaw was conducted in teams of four to learn about mechanisms of motion conversion, and develop skills in SOLIDWORKS; I was responsible for the CAD of the blade holder, as well as assembly of the jigsaw CAD. This was our first group project in SOLIDWORKS, and I learned how to create parts in a way that was easy for others to understand, whether it be renaming features, using smart dimensions, or organizing tree items.
