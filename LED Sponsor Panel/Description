In grade 12, I designed a LED sponsor board for use in our robotics team’s displays at competitions. The LED light base was purchased, and the panel’s design was done on Illustrator; it includes all of our team’s high level sponsors, and utilizes the bear motif to be consistent with the branding expectations. The acrylic panel was laser etched and cut by a local sponsor.
