			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Since I was small, I had always been interested in robots, and how they learned to mimic human behaviour. I had the opportunity to see ASIMO in person at the Miraikan in Tokyo, and watched the robot perform a backflip, and score a soccer ball. It amazed me how people were able to recreate human-like joints and limbs out of metal, wires, and plastic. <br>
			Seeing ASIMO in action sparked an interest for robotics in me, and engineering seemed like the obvious choice for me to make to learn more about the field. However, I soon learned that engineering is more than just physics and calculation; it's a way of thinking, and a way of objectively looking at a problem to come up with the best solution. <br>
			In the future I hope to specialize in mechatronics, developing integrated robotic mechanisms to help enhance human life.</p>

		      		<h2>Robotics for Space Exploration</h2>
		        	<p>During first year, I created a battery and circuit panel mount for the Robotics for Space Exploration design team’s 2019-2020 Mars Rover. In this project, I was required to communicate with both the mechanical and electrical sub-teams to design a system that was compact, robust, and allowed for quick battery exchanges during competitions.</p>

		      	<h2>MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design</h2>
		        <p>In MIE243, our 2nd year mechanical engineering design course, we designed gearboxes in groups of 4 to apply the knowledge we had acquired in class. We were required to design gearboxes which were completely 3D printed under 8 hours; they were 3D printed in the University of Toronto mechanical engineering facilities and assembled by a teaching assistant; w. This gearbox has a 16:1 reduction, and has a colinear input and output. </p>

		      	<h1>LED Sponsor Board</h1>
		      	<h2>FRC Team 6135: Arctos</h2>
		        <p>In grade 12, I designed a LED sponsor board for use in our robotics team’s displays at competitions. The LED light base was purchased, and the panel’s design was done on Illustrator; it includes all of our team’s high level sponsors, and utilizes the bear motif to be consistent with the branding expectations. The acrylic panel was laser etched and cut by a local sponsor.</p>
