			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi! My name is Erika Narimatsu, and I'm a 2nd year mechanical engineering student at the University of Toronto. I love the hands-on aspect of mechanical engineering, and the pride in seeing something I designed come to life. In my free time, I love to bake, listen to music, and play video games.</p>
			<h2> My Inspirations </h2>
			<p> When I was in middle school, I had the opportunity to see ASIMO in person at the Miraikan in Tokyo, and watched the robot perform backflips and score soccer balls. I was amazed at how it was able to interact with audience members and behave like a human would. Learning about robotic systems like ASIMO and my own experienced with FIRST Robotics inspired me to pursue engineering in post-secondary education.  </p>
			<h2>My Aspirations</h2>
			<p> Robots and mechatronics create opportunities to enhance human life and allow us to challenge the boundaries of our own capability; robots like ASIMO and Pepper create new possibiltiy and care, therapy and rehabilitation, while Da Vinci's Intuitive allows us to increase surpass the limits of human precision and accuracy in surgery. In third year, I hope to specialize in mechatronics (and solid mechanics or bioengineering) to develop the skills and knowledge needed to create robotic systems. By contributing to the innovation of robotic systems, I hope to one day be part of something that helps change someone's life for the better.</p>

		    		<h1>Battery Bay Design</h1>
		      		<h2>Robotics for Space Exploration</h2>
		        	<p>During first year, I created a battery and circuit panel mount for the Robotics for Space Exploration design team’s 2019-2020 Mars Rover. In this project, I learned how to effectively communicate with both the mechanical and electrical sub-teams to meet everyone's needs and design a system that was compact, robust, and simple.</p>

		      	<h1>Gearbox</h1>
		      	<h2>MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design</h2>
		        <p>In MIE243, our 2nd year mechanical engineering design course, we designed, and then 3D printed, gearboxes in groups of 4 to apply the knowledge we had acquired in class; I was responsible for the design of the housings, as well as the assembly of the gearbox CAD. This gearbox has a 16:1 reduction, and has a colinear input and output. In this project, I learned how to apply the correct tolerances to a design, and optimize design for ease of manufacturing and assembly. </p>

		      	<h1>LED Sponsor Board</h1>
		      	<h2>FRC Team 6135: Arctos</h2>
		        <p>In grade 12, I designed a LED sponsor board for use in our robotics team’s displays at competitions. The LED light base was purchased, and the panel’s design was done on Illustrator; it includes all of our team’s high level sponsors, and utilizes the bear motif to be consistent with the branding expectations. The acrylic panel was laser etched and cut by a local sponsor.</p>

		      	<h2>Personal project</h2>
		        <p>The website displaying the portfolio is custom coded, using HTML and CSS. This allowed me to develop understanding and competency in graphic design, web design and programming.</p>
