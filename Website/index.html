			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi! My name is Erika Narimatsu, and I'm a 2nd year mechanical engineering student at the University of Toronto. I love the hands-on aspect of mechanical engineering, and the pride in seeing something I designed come to life. In my free time, I love to bake, listen to music, and play video games.</p>
			<h2> My Inspirations </h2>
			<p> When I was in middle school, I had the opportunity to see ASIMO in person at the Miraikan in Tokyo, and watched the robot perform backflips and score soccer balls. I was amazed at how it was able to interact with audience members and behave like a human would. Learning about robotic systems like ASIMO, and my own experiences with FIRST Robotics inspired me to pursue engineering in post-secondary education.  </p>
			<h2>My Aspirations</h2>
			<p> Robots and mechatronics create opportunities to enhance human life and allow us to challenge the boundaries of our own capability; robots like ASIMO and Pepper create new possibilities and care, therapy and rehabilitation, while Da Vinci's Intuitive allows us to increase surpass the limits of human precision and accuracy in surgery. In third year, I hope to specialize in mechatronics (and solid mechanics or bioengineering) to develop the skills and knowledge needed to create robotic systems. By contributing to the innovation of robotic systems, I hope to one day be part of something that helps change someone's life for the better.</p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>The design process defines each step, part and action required to bring an idea to life with practicality and purpose. While teamwork creates the collaborative environment which powers the design process, individual work allows people to develop, and contribute their own skills. The design process is supported by, and cannot function without, both teamwork and individual work. My projects, as shown below, have helped me to develop my skills in both teamwork, and individual work. </p>

		      		<h2>Robotics for Space Exploration</h2>
		        	<p>In first year, I created the battery and circuit panel mount for RSX’s 2019-2020 Mars Rover, which is made of 3D printed PLA, and laser cut acrylic. In this project, I was required to design a system that was compact, robust, and allowed for quick battery exchanges during competitions. In this project, I learned how to effectively communicate with team members of diverse technical backgrounds to develop a design which met everyone’s needs.</p>

		      	<h2>MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design</h2>
		        <p>In MIE243, our 2nd year mechanical engineering design course, we designed (and then 3D printed) gearboxes in teams of 4 to apply the knowledge we had acquired in class; I was responsible for the design of the housings, as well as the assembly of the gearbox CAD. This gearbox has a 16:1 reduction, and has a collinear input and output. In this project, I learned how to apply the correct tolerances to a design, and optimize design for ease of manufacturing and assembly. </p>

		      	<h2>MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design</h2>
		        <p>In MIE243, our 2nd year mechanical engineering design course, dissection and analysis of a jigsaw was conducted in teams of four to learn about mechanisms of motion conversion, and develop skills in SOLIDWORKS; I was responsible for the CAD of the blade holder, as well as assembly of the jigsaw CAD. This was our first group project in SOLIDWORKS, and I learned how to create parts in a way that was easy for others to understand, whether it be renaming features, using smart dimensions, or organizing tree items.</p>

		      	<h2>Personal project</h2>
		        <p>This website is custom coded using HTML and CSS, and published using Github and Netlify. In this project, I was able to further develop competency in graphic design and programming. Furthermore,  I learned how to think from a user perspective and test various edge cases to create a site which was easy to read, visually appealing, and compatible on different devices/browsers.</p>
